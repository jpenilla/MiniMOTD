### MiniMOTD is a basic server list MOTD plugin/mod for Minecraft servers and proxies

- MiniMOTD supports RGB colors and gradients through [MiniMessage](https://github.com/KyoriPowered/adventure-text-minimessage), which is also where MiniMOTD gets it's name.
- For more detailed info on formatting text, refer to the [MiniMessage docs](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage.html).
- RGB colors are automatically downsampled for outdated clients.
- RGB colors are only able to be sent by proxies and 1.16+ servers, and can only be seen by 1.16+ clients.

#### Server Platforms
- [Paper](https://papermc.io/) / Spigot
  - MiniMOTD is compatible with Spigot, however many features will not work. It is recommended to use Paper for full compatibility.
- [Sponge API 8](https://www.spongepowered.org/)
- [Sponge API 7](https://www.spongepowered.org/)
- [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) (requires [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api))

#### Proxy Platforms

- [Waterfall](https://papermc.io/downloads#Waterfall) / Bungeecord

#### Downloads
Downloads can be obtained from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/jpenilla/MiniMOTD/releases). There is a separate jar for each platform, as well as a universal jar for all platforms. Paper and Spigot share the same jar, as do Waterfall and Bungeecord.
